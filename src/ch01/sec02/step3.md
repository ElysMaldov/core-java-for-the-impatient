Look at the last line of the output, generated by

```
System.out.println('\u263A');
```

If this looks like a ? and not a smiley face ☺, then run the program inside the editor instead. Click on the Run command above the `main` method, and watch the output in the editor's terminal window. You should then see the ☺.

Modify the program so that it prints the next Unicode character, i.e. the one with value `'\u263A' + 1`.
