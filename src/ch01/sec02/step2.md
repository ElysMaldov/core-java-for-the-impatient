Run the program:

`java ch01/sec02/NumberDemo.java`{{execute}}

Note that you do not need to compile a program with a single source file. The compiler is automatically invoked. (If you run the program multiple times, it is more efficient to compile it first.)

Carefully look at the output of the six statements that follow the `// Infinity and NaN` comment. What do you notice? (You may want to add a print statement to make it easier to find the values in the output.)
