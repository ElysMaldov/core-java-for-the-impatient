You can compile and run the MethodDemo program on the command line.

`javac ch01/sec01/MethodDemo.java && java ch01.sec01.MethodDemo`{{execute}}

Or you can click the Run link in the editor.

Match up the input with the output. What does the second output line mean?

Now change World to 🌐 or 🏴‍☠️ and run the program again. Can you explain how the second output line changed?
