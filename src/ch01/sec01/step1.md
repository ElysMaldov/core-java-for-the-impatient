Compile the HelloWorld program in a terminal window.

`javac ch01/sec01/HelloWorld.java`{{execute}}

Run it.

`java ch01.sec01.HelloWorld`{{execute}}

You can type the commands into the terminal on the right and hit Enter after each of them. 

Or simply click on the black lines, and they are copied and executed automatically.

Now change the program so that it says hello to someone or something else. 

To see the program, expand the >ch01 directory in the "Explorer" window of the code editor above the terminal.
