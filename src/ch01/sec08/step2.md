Write a `ArrayAndArrayListDemo` program that does the following:
* Add ten random letters to an array and an array list. Get them as follows:
  ```
  int r = generator.nextInt(26);
  String randomLetter = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ".substring(r, r + 1);
  ```
* Using enhanced `for` loops, print the contents of the array and array list.
* Using regular `for` loops, print the contents of the array and array list in reverse order.

How will your program change if the number of elements is variable?
