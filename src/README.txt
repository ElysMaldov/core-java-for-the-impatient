The examples for the first eleven chapters are in packages chX/secY.
You can compile and run them from the command line:

javac ch01/sec01/HelloWorld.java
java ch01.sec01.HelloWorld

In your IDE, you can make a single project consisting of all files EXCEPT 
for the ch12 directory. 

Each IDE has a preferred directory for project source files, such as src/ or
src/main/java/. If you want to follow that structure, create the base directory
and move all directories and files except ch12 into it. 

Alternatively, tell your IDE not to create a separate source directory and to 
exclude ch12 from the project.

The examples for Chapter 12 come with command-line instructions. 

It is possible to use an IDE, but the setup is complex. Make a project for each
of the ch12.XXX and com.horstmann.XXX module subdirectories. Tell your IDE 
where to find the necessary modules for each project.
