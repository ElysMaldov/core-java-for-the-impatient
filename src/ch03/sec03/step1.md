1. Does the `LocalDate` class implement the `Comparable` interface? Find out from the API documentation. If so, declare an array of `LocalDate` and verify that it is correctly sorted. You may want to use JShell or write a small test program. Remember to import the `java.time` package.
2. Make an `Object[]` array holding `System.in`, `System.out`, and `System.err`. Try sorting it. What happens?
